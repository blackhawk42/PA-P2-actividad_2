# Program

A sequence of instructions that, following the rules of a programming language,
implement an algorithm; the instructions to be performed on data to
execute a given piece of work (Garza & Briseño, 2008, p. 178; 
Mano, 1994, p. 2).

# Process

For a program to run, it must be converted to a process (Garza & Briseño, 2008, p. 178).
A process can be said to be a copy or instance of a program in execution, which is
controlled and timed by the operating system (Stallings, 200, p. 710).

# Thread

It's "an independent piece of code to complete a specific function" (Jerraya, A. A. & Wolf, W., 2005, p. 
510). It is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be independently
managed by the computer's scheduler. A process may have multiple threads executing
concurrently (Wikipedia, 2019).

# Job

"A unit of work performed by a computer without human intervention" (Saigh, 1998).

# Task

A task is an operating system concept. Basically, it's the combination of a program
and the bookkeeping information necessary to execute it and organize such execution.
When an operating system can execute many tasks at the same time, it is said to be
_multitasking_ (Webopedia.com, n. d.).

A task is said to be the basic unit of work a computer can do (Jerraya, A. A. & Wolf, W., 2005, p. 286;
Whatis.com, n.d.), and a job may be described as a collection of tasks (Wikipedia, 2018).
